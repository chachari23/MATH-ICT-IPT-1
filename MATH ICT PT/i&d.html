<p><h1> Independent & Dependent Variables </h1><p>
<p>"Independent and dependent variables are types of variables that are used in mathematics, statistics, and the experimental studies.<br> Generally, the dependent variable is the variable in a function or experiment whose value depends on the independent variable.<br> The independent variable is the known variable that is manipulated in order to determine its effect (if any) on the dependent variable." <br> The Independent Variable is commonly x, while the Dependent Variable is commonly y.</p>
<br><br><br><p><h1> Examples </h1><br><p>Ex 1: A worker gets paid 47 pesos per hour. The worker gets 282 pesos for working 6 hours, 423 pesos for 9 hours,<br> 470 pesos for 10 hours, and 611 pesos for 13 hours.

<br><br>Independent Variable: 47 pesos per hour
<br>Dependent Variable: Number of hours worked</p>
<br><br><br><p>Ex 2: Pablo just arrived from school. He has 5 hours to complete 7 activities. Pablo spent an hour and 30 minutes to eat dinner and shower.<br> Pablo completes 3 activities in an hour. Pablo completes 2 activities in 45 minutes.<br> The remaining time Pablo had, he finished the remaining 2 activities.

<br><br>Independent Variable: The number of hours Pablo has

<br>Dependent Variable: How many activities can Pablo finish</p><br><br><br><p>Ex 3: Mary has a 3000 peso budget. She bought 2  whole pieces of chicken, 3 pieces of eggs, 5 onions, 5 garlics, 4 eggplants, and 3 cartons of milk.<br> The price of whole piece chicken is 750 pesos per piece. The price of an egg is 10 pesos each. The price of onion is 30 pesos per piece. The price of garlic is 35 pesos per piece.<br> The price of an eggplant is 75 pesos each. The price for a carton of milk is 125 pesos per piece.

<br><br>Independent Variable: The budget of Mary

<br>Dependent Variable: How many things she wants to buy</p>
